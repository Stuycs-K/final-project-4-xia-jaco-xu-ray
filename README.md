THE MONOPOLY ELEPHANTS

## Overview

Monopoly is a popular board game in which players aim to become wealthy by buying, trading, and developing properties (if applicable, with houses and hotels). The game starts with each player rolling dice to move around the board, able to purchase available properties they land on, or obligated to pay rent if on other playersâ€™ owned properties. The objective is to bankrupt other players (i.e. when they have no money in the bank), making one player the monopolist.

## Instructions

The game starts with asking how many players will be playing (2-4). Press key on keyboard corresponding to a number in that range.
The game then begins automatically. Note that the players' balances are always displayed in the upper left corner, and the current dice roll is displayed on the lower left corner.
If a player lands on an empty space, nothing will happen and the next player will automatically go.
If a player lands on jail, they will be jailed for 3 rounds unless they bail out through monetary ($50) means or luck (rolling a 4 is equivalent to chances of rolling a double).
If a player lands on a space, they are able to purchase or skip. If a player does not have enough money, they will not be able to purchase the space.
If a player runs out of cash, they will be prompted to sell owned property. If such selling does not bring the player's balance back to net positive, the player is bankrupt and out of the game.
When a player passes 'Go,' they receive monetary compensation ($200).



SHORTCUTS:
'z' to deduct all players' balances by $200.
't' to teleport all players to a random space on the board. 
'd' to disrupt regular gameplay flow: shows sell/upgrade functionality for space Med(iterranean) Ave.
'j' to disrupt regular gameplay flow: puts all players in jail.
