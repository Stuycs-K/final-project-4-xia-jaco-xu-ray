Classwork: Created files for the classes in processing. Added some methods
but have not implemented them yet. Still need to add the rest of the
methods before starting work. Homework: implemented the Street class.

### 5/23/24

Classwork+Homework: Started working on constructing/initializing
the board array (using 40 spaces like a real monopoly board, but
putting empty spaces things like chance cards that we decided to
cut out for now). Successfully created all the streets and created
the array. Next steps are to make sure that the graphics logic will work accordingly.
